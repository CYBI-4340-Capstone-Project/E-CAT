# Argus Setup & Usage Guide for Virtualized Ubuntu (Hyper-V)
### This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up and running Argus on a virtualized Ubuntu machine (Hyper-V Manager). It also includes troubleshooting tips and useful commands to manage and archive network traffic logs.

# Installing Argus
## Step 1: Install Argus & Argus Clients
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install argus-server argus-client -y
### On the Argus website it says "argus-clients" however the command only runs when it is "argus-client" and not "argus-clients". It will say "argus-client is could not be found". 
## Step 2: Verify Installation
        argus -h
        ra -h
### You should see version information and other CLI arguments

# Additional Steps for Setup
## Creating Necessary Directories
### Ensure the necessary directories exist and have the correct permissions:
        sudo mkdir -p /etc/argus
        sudo mkdir -p /var/log/argus
        sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/argus/argus.archive
        sudo chmod 755 /etc/argus
        sudo chmod 755 /var/log/argus
        sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/argus/argus.archive
## Copying Files from GitHub Repository
### Download and copy the argusarchive script from the Argus GitHub Repository: 
        wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openargus/argus/master/support/Archive/argusarchive
        sudo mv argusarchive /usr/local/bin/argusarchive
        sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/argusarchive
### You can also click on the Argus GitHub link in the "Additional Resources" section at the bottom and manually download or copy and paste the file. It can be found under "argus-5.0/support/Archive/argusarchive". You will also need to download excel.rc that can be found under "argus-clients-5.0/support/Config/excel.rc" and move it to "/etc/argus/excel.rc".
### Additionally, modified versions of argus.conf, argus.service, argusarchive, and excel.rc are included in this repository for reference. These are not the default versions from Argus but have been configured specifically for this setup.
## Configuring argus.conf
### Ensure your argus.conf file is correctly configured. The following are the key settings, but the file contains more options scattered throughout: 
        ARGUS_ACCESS_PORT=561
        ARGUS_INTERFACE=eth0
        ARGUS_OUTPUT_FILE=/var/log/argus/argus.out
        ARGUS_RA_RCFILE="/etc/argus/excel.rc"
        ARGUS_FLOW_STATUS_INTERVAL=5
        ARGUS_MAR_STATUS_INTERVAL=60
        ARGUS_GENERATE_RESPONSE_TIME_DATA=yes
        ARGUS_GENERATE_PACKET_SIZE=yes
        ARGUS_GENERATE_JITTER_DATA=yes
        ARGUS_GENERATE_APPBYTE_METRIC=yes
        ARGUS_GENERATE_TCP_PERF_METRIC=yes
        ARGUS_GENERATE_BIDIRECTIONAL_TIMESTAMPS=yes
        ARGUS_CAPTURE_DATA_LEN=32
        ARGUS_FILTER_OPTIMIZER=yes
        ARGUS_SELF_SYNCHRONIZE=yes 
### This argus.conf file can be found in the repository, but it has been modified to match this specific setup. Ensure you review it before replacing your configuration, especially the ARGUS_INTERFACE which can be found by running IP A to find your network interface.

# Running Argus & Capturing Traffic
## Start Argus Manually
        sudo argus -d -P 561 -i eth0 -w /var/log/argus/argus.out -F /etc/argus/argus.conf
### CLI Arguments Explained:
    - -d --> Run as a daemon (option).
    - -P --> Listen on port 561 (default).
    - -i eth0 --> Monitor the eth0 interface (ip a to confirm interface).
    - -w /var/log/argus/argus.out --> Store logs in this file.
    - -F /etc/argus/argus.conf --> Use the Argus config file.

## View Captured Traffic (Real-Time)
        ra -S localhost:561 
### Tip: Load Firefox, Youtube, or any site to generate network traffic

## Stopping Argus
### Find and kill the process:
        ps aux | grep argus     # Find the Argus PID
        sudo kill -9 <PID>      # Replace <PID> with the actual process ID
### Another way to verify Argus is listening/running
        sudo netstat -tulnp | grep 561
        sudo netstat -tulnp | grep argus

# Archiving & Converting Logs
## Once you stop Argus, archive the logs:
        sudo /usr/local/bin/argusarchive    # Ensure Argus is not running beforehand
## This will:
    - Move /var/log/argus/argus.out to a date-organized archive (/usr/local/argus/argus.archive/).
    - Create compressed .gz of the raw log file (argus.out)
    - Also automatically creates a .csv version of the log file (argus.out).
### The archived logs are stored in a structured calendar-based directory. An example is included in this repository (argus.archive) to illustrate the structure, but your actual logs will be generated dynamically.
## Example Archive Directory:
        /usr/local/argus/argus.archive/2025/02/12/
        ├── argus.2025.02.12.22.40.49.0.csv
        ├── argus.2025.02.12.22.40.49.0.gz
        ├── argus.2025.02.12.22.34.02.0.csv
        ├── argus.2025.02.12.22.34.02.0.gz
## The following is the command on how to convert the argus.out file to .csv manually:
        ra -r /var/log/argus/argus.out -F /etc/argus/excel.rc -s stime ltime proto saddr sport daddr dport state dur sbytes dbytes sttl dttl sloss dloss service sload dload spkts dpkts swin dwin stcpb dtcpb smeansz dmeansz trans_depth res_bdy_len sjit djit sintpkt dintpkt tcprtt synack ackdat is_sm_ips_ports ct_state_ttl ct_flw_http_mthd is_ftp_login ct_ftp_cmd ct_srv_src ct_srv_dst ct_dst_ltm ct_src_ltm ct_src_dport_ltm ct_dst_sport_ltm ct_dst_src_ltm -c ',' > /var/log/argus/argus_data.csv

# Setting Up Argus as a Systemd Service (WORK IN PROGRESS)
### The argus.service file, included in this repository, is a modified version intended for automatic service management.
## Step 1: Create a Systemd Service
        sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/argus.service
### Paste the following:
[Unit]
Description=Start Argus daemon
After=network.target
[Service]
ExecStartPre=/sbin/ifconfig eth0 up
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/argus -d -P 561 -i eth0 -w /var/log/argus/argus.out -F /etc/argus/argus.conf
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
## Step 2: Reload Systemd & Start Argus
        sudo systemctl daemon-reload
        sudo systemctl enable argus
        sudo systemctl start argus
## Step 3: Check Status
        sudo systemctl status argus
### Argus should now auto-start on boot

# Troubleshooting & Fixes (WORK IN PROGRESS)
## Connection Refused on ra -S localhost:561
        ra[6330]: connect to 127.0.0.1:561 failed 'Connection Refused'
### Check if Argus is running:
        sudo systemctl status argus
### This is assuming you have set up the argus.service file and didn't start Argus manually. If you run this command when you started argus manually it WILL say that Argus is dead (inactive) which can be confusing. 
### Restart Argus: 
        sudo systemctl restart argus
### Check if the port is in use, also if Argus is running: 
        sudo netstat -tulnp | grep 561
        sudo netstat -tulnp | grep argus
### If Argus is running, whether on port 561 or another port, or if another service is already using 561. You can kill it with: 
        sudo kill -9 <PID>      # Replace <PID> with the process ID of the process
## bind() error on Start
        ArgusEstablishListen: bind() error
### This error almost exclusively means that there is already a service using the port number. Use the following command to find the process: 
        sudo netstat -tulnp | grep 561
### Kill the process: 
        sudo kill -9 <PID>
### If you have killed the process but still receive this error. Change the port number to 562 or another port number, this should fix it. 
## start-limit-hit Systemd Failure (STILL TROUBLESHOOTING)
        argus.service: Failed with result 'start-limit-hit'
### This error means that there is something wrong with the argus.service file, not Argus itself. You are still able to run Argus with the manual command. STILL TROUBLESHOOTING TRYING TO FIX THE argus.service file or find out why it doesn't want to work when trying to run it with sudo systemctl start argus
## Viewing logs: 
        sudo journalctl -xe
        sudo journalctl -u argus --no-pager | tail -30
